I'm entirely new to programming, sort of. But since hearing of this watch, I had an idea to try and make a PipBoy inspired interface for this watch. I have no idea how to do that though, but this will be my goal for this watch. I also have other time display ideas I'd like to develop over time, but need to learn python before I can get these launched.
